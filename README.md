# mode.c
/* the code can be used for 
arrays with only one mode.
For the multimodal arrays 
it gives the first mode it encounters 
in the sorted array .

O(nlog n) or O( n^2) for quick sort 
then O(n) for the linear search of 
the mode in the array.*/

# bitonic.c
code for peak finding and identical
binary search algorithm with each 
O(log n) complexity .

# sudoku python
A backtracking solution for solving sudoku 
problems .
